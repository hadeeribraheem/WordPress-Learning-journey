          The wp_head() function is typically called in the <head> section of your themeâ€™s header.php file.
          Purpose:
               It outputs critical scripts, styles, meta tags, and other elements added by WordPress core, plugins, and themes.
               Without wp_head(), many functionalities (like loading CSS/JavaScript or SEO metadata) will not work properly.
